Open questions
- If there's an insufficient amount of labor to complete the sowing in one week, what is the likely outcome? Would they take help from other households or just sow later?
- How best to model the inefficiency in trade? Merchants visited infrequently and markets were small
- What were large landowners likely to be farming. What population did the manor usually contain?
- How did the process of plowing actually work? What downsides were there to plowing off peak? What if you plowed without a plow team?
- Would 3 field crop rotation fields be equivalent size?
- How much food would a lord have on hand vs wealth? How much would his household consume?

To Do

refactor graphing to be separate classes
    possibly move the prep dataset method out of graphing and into the class calling it
refactor field sow, harvest etc to be outside of household
